Please use the Emacs Stackexchange site [1] or the Gitter chat [2]
for support requests.  But before you do that please read the list
of frequently asked questions [3] and consult the manual [4].

We only use this issue tracker for feature requests and for defects.

How to ask for a new feature requests
=====================================

Before you ask for a new feature to be added to Magit please make
sure that the feature does not in fact already exist by consulting
the manual [5].

Then explain what new feature you would like to see in Magit and
why that is useful.

=====================
How to report defects
=====================

Please explain
  (1) what behavior you expected
  (2) what behavior you observed
  (3) and how we can reproduce that issue.

Also post the output of

  M-x magit-version RET

Before reporting an issue please try to reproduce it using an Emacs
instance in which only Magit and its dependencies have been loaded.
Other packages or your configuration should not be loaded.  This makes
it easier to determine whether the issue lays with Magit or something
else.

If you run Magit from its Git repository, then you can do so using:

  $ cd /path/to/magit
  $ make magit

If you installed it using package.el, then run commands similar to the
ones below, but use tab completion to replace the various Ns with the
correct numbers:

  $ cd ~/.emacs.d/elpa/magit-N
  $ emacs -Q --debug-init --eval '(setq debug-on-error t)' \
      -L ../dash-N -L with-editor-N -L lisp -l magit
