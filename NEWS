Changes in magit 0.6:

* Magit works with Git 1.6.0 now.  (John Wiegley)

* Key bindings and command behavior for diffing, history listing, and
  resetting have changed.  Please see the manual.

* All buffers created by Magit are now in magit-mode and share all key
  bindings.

* Bug fix: avoid looking-at-p so that magit.el works on Emacs 22 as
  well.
