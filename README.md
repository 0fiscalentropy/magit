It's Magit!  A Git Porcelain inside Emacs
=========================================

**The Magit wiki contains a list of [FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS][faq],
please do consult it.**

**Magit is in [FEATURE FREEZE][roadmap], keep that in mind when making
feature requests.**

Magit is an interface to the version control system [Git][git],
implemented as an [Emacs][emacs] package.

Unlike the [VC][vc] package which is part of Emacs and strives to
provide a unified interface to various version control systems, Magit
only supports Git and can therefore better take advantage of its
native features.

Installation
============

*Magit 2.0.50 requires at least GNU Emacs 24.4 and Git 1.9.4.*

Instructions on how to install the `2.0.50` pre-release can be found
[here](http://magit.vc/manual/magit/Installation.html).  `2.1.0` will
be released on the 1th of July.

Instructions on how to install the `1.4.2` release can be found
[here](https://github.com/magit/magit/wiki/Installation).

Getting Help

When something doesn't work as expected please see the [FAQ][faq], and

[Emacs Stackexchange][emacsstack] site or the [mailing list][group].
