;;; Introduction

;; Invoking the git-status function will show a buffer with the
;; current status of the current git repository and its checkout.
;; That buffer offers key bindings for manipulating the status in
;; simple ways.
;;
;; The status buffer mainly shows the difference between the working
;; tree and the index, and the difference between the index and the
;; current HEAD.  You can 'stage' individual hunks from the working
;; tree to the index, and you can commit the index.  The commit
;; message needs to be prepared in a special area of the status buffer
;; before committing.
;;
;; The status buffer also supports resolving conflicts.
