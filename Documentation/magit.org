Magit is an interface to the version control system Git, implemented
as an Emacs package.

This manual is only a stub, not even a draft.  The draft for what will
become the manual for the upcoming ~2.1.0~ release is currently
maintained in the webpage repository.  It will be moved into the
source repository once it is mostly finished.  You can read the draft
online at http://magit.vc/manual.  The draft and earlier versions of
the manual can also be downloaded in various formats from that same
page.
