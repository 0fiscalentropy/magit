Magit v2.7.0 Release Notes (draft)
==================================

Changes since v2.6.2
--------------------

* Added new popup `magit-subtree-popup' and bound "O" to it.

* Added new commands `magit-worktree-checkout',
  `magit-worktree-branch', `magit-worktree-delete',
  and `magit-worktree-status'.

* Added new section inserter `magit-insert-worktrees'

* The command `magit-stage' learned to stage an untracked file while
  leaving its content unstaged (i.e. `git add --intent-to-add') when
  called with a prefix argument.

* The command `magit-reverse' learned to use `--reject' to ensure that
  non-conflicting hunks are applied and that conflicting hunks are put
  into reject files.

* When the command `magit-discard' is used on staged changes, then
  that is done by first reversing the changes in the index and then in
  the working tree.  The second step could fail due to conflicts.  Now
  the `--reject' argument is used, which ensures that non-conflicting
  hunks are applied and that conflicting hunks are put into reject
  files.

* The command `magit-rebase--continue' learned to reuse the old commit
  message as-is when called with a prefix argument.

* In the refs buffer symbolic refs, such as "remotes/origin/HEAD", are
  no longer omitted from the lists of local and remote branches.
