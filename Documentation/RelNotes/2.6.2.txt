Magit v2.6.2 Release Notes (draft)
==================================

Fixes since v2.6.1
------------------

* When possible `git merge (--no-commit|--edit)' perform fast-forward
  merges, which isn't what one would expect.  `magit-merge-nocommit'
  and `magit-merge-editmsg' now works around that by always using
  `--no-ff'.
