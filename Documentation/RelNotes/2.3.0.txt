It's Magit!  A Git Porcelain inside Emacs
=========================================

Magit is an interface to the version control system Git, implemented
as an Emacs package.  Magit aspires to be a complete Git porcelain.
While we cannot (yet) claim that Magit wraps and improves upon each
and every Git command, it is complete enough to allow even experienced
Git users to perform almost all of their daily version control tasks
directly from within Emacs.  While many fine Git clients exist, only
Magit and Git itself deserve to be called porcelains.

Magit v2.3.0 Release Notes
==========================

UNRELEASED.

Changes since v2.2.0
--------------------

THIS IS NOT COMPLETE.

* Information about related refs in `magit-revision-mode' buffers are
  now grouped in the same section as other headers and are formatted
  like those other headers instead of like diffstats.  The redundant
  header which previously grouped the related refs section is gone.
  All headers are inserted by the new `magit-insert-revision-headers'
  section inserter.  #2216
