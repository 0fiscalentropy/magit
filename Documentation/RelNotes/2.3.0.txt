It's Magit!  A Git Porcelain inside Emacs
=========================================

Magit is an interface to the version control system Git, implemented
as an Emacs package.  Magit aspires to be a complete Git porcelain.
While we cannot (yet) claim that Magit wraps and improves upon each
and every Git command, it is complete enough to allow even experienced
Git users to perform almost all of their daily version control tasks
directly from within Emacs.  While many fine Git clients exist, only
Magit and Git itself deserve to be called porcelains.

Magit v2.3.0 Release Notes
==========================

UNRELEASED.

Changes since v2.2.0
--------------------

THIS IS NOT COMPLETE.

* Added `--interactive' switch to `magit-rebase-popup' so that rebase
  variants which normally perform a non-interactive rebase can be used
  interactively too.  #2186

* Commands that perform an interactive rebase should no longer be used
  non-interactively.  #2187

* Rebasing commands now can start with a root commit.  #2187

* New command `magit-checkout-file'.

* Added new option `magit-bury-buffer-function' to give users more
  control over how Magit buffers are buried, replacing the old binary
  option `magit-restore-window-configuration'.  The default is still
  the same, i.e. `magit-restore-window-configuration' is used.  #2193

* Added new function `magit-mode-quit-window' as a simpler variant to
  `magit-restore-window-configuration'.  #2193
