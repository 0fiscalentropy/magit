It's Magit!  A Git Porcelain inside Emacs
=========================================

Magit is an interface to the version control system Git, implemented
as an Emacs package.  Magit aspires to be a complete Git porcelain.
While we cannot (yet) claim that Magit wraps and improves upon each
and every Git command, it is complete enough to allow even experienced
Git users to perform almost all of their daily version control tasks
directly from within Emacs.  While many fine Git clients exist, only
Magit and Git itself deserve to be called porcelains.

Magit v2.3.0 Release Notes
==========================

UNRELEASED.

Changes since v2.2.0
--------------------

THIS IS NOT COMPLETE.

* Information about related refs in `magit-revision-mode' buffers are
  now grouped in the same section as other headers and are formatted
  like those other headers instead of like diffstats.  The redundant
  header which previously grouped the related refs section is gone.
  All headers are inserted by the new `magit-insert-revision-headers'
  section inserter.  #2216

* No longer avoid calling git more than absolutely necessary when
  creating a `magit-revision-mode' buffer.  This simplifies parsing,
  makes it simpler to prettify how information is presented, allows
  users to customize how and in what order information is presented,
  and prepares for faster, asynchronously created diffs.  #2216

* The various sections in revision buffers are now inserted using new
  section inserters named `magit-insert-revision-{*}', all of which
  are part of the default value of `magit-revision-sections-hook'.
  #2216

* The various sections in diff buffers are now inserted using new
  section inserters named `magit-insert-diff-{*}', all of which are
  part of the default value of `magit-diff-sections-hook'.  #2216

* Added new option `magit-revision-headers-format' whose value is
  passed to `git show --format=' to insert most of the headers,
  excluding the related-refs headers.  The default value now uses
  placeholders which respect information in the file ".mailmap".
  #2216

* Removed options `magit-revision-show-notes',
  `magit-diff-show-xref-buttons', `magit-revision-show-xref-buttons',
  `magit-diff-show-diffstat', and `magit-revision-show-diffstat'.
  Whether these sections are inserted is now controlled using the
  hooks `magit-diff-section-hook' and `magit-revision-section-hook'.
  #2216

* Gravatar images are now shown in `magit-revision-buffers' be
  default.  New option `magit-revision-show-gravatars' controls
  whether these images should be inserted and can also be used to
  adjust to customization of `magit-revision-headers-format'.  #2216
