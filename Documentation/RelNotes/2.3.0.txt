It's Magit!  A Git Porcelain inside Emacs
=========================================

Magit is an interface to the version control system Git, implemented
as an Emacs package.  Magit aspires to be a complete Git porcelain.
While we cannot (yet) claim that Magit wraps and improves upon each
and every Git command, it is complete enough to allow even experienced
Git users to perform almost all of their daily version control tasks
directly from within Emacs.  While many fine Git clients exist, only
Magit and Git itself deserve to be called porcelains.

Magit v2.3.0 Release Notes
==========================

UNRELEASED.

Changes since v2.2.0
--------------------

THIS IS NOT COMPLETE.

* After using the region to stage or discard parts of a hunk, point is
  now placed on the beginning of the next or previous block of changed
  lines.  Previously we just jumped to the beginning of the hunk at
  the same index as the previous hunk, but that often was very far
  away from where point was before the refresh.  #2227
