It's Magit!  A Git Porcelain inside Emacs
=========================================

Magit is an interface to the version control system Git, implemented
as an Emacs package.  Magit aspires to be a complete Git porcelain.
While we cannot (yet) claim that Magit wraps and improves upon each
and every Git command, it is complete enough to allow even experienced
Git users to perform almost all of their daily version control tasks
directly from within Emacs.  While many fine Git clients exist, only
Magit and Git itself deserve to be called porcelains.

Magit v2.2.0 Release Notes
==========================

UNRELEASED.

Changes since v2.1.0
--------------------

THIS IS NOT COMPLETE.

* Two new commands have been added to the diff refresh popup that
  allow the range of the previous diff to be manipulated.
  `magit-diff-flip-revs' swaps the revisions of the range, and
  `magit-diff-switch-range-type' toggles between ".." and "..." range
  types.

* The commands `magit-ediff-show-unstaged', `magit-ediff-show-staged',
  `magit-ediff-show-commit', and `magit-ediff-show-working-tree' have
  been added to the Ediff popup.

* A new option, `magit-ediff-dwim-show-on-hunks', controls whether
  calling `magit-ediff-dwim' runs a show variant
  (`magit-ediff-show-unstaged' or `magit-ediff-show-staged') rather
  than `magit-ediff-stage' when point is on an uncommitted hunk.

* `magit-diff' and `magit-ediff-compare' no longer prompt the user for
  confirmation when constructing a range from the last and first
  commits selected by a region.  A prefix argument can now be used to
  specify that the diff is between the second revision and the common
  ancestor of both revisions (i.e., the "..." range type is used).

* `magit-ediff-*' variants now limit file chocies to those that have
  changed between the revisions of interest.  If only one file has
  changed, this file is used without prompting.

* `magit-diff' and `magit-ediff-compare' now consider the location at
  point when choosing the default for the prompt, and this default
  value usually corresponds with the actions of their DWIM
  counterparts.

* The key in Ediff popup for `magit-ediff-compare' has changed from
  "d" to "r" to be consistent with the key in the diff popup for the
  similarly behaved `magit-diff`.

* Entering a single commit for the range to `magit-ediff-compare' now
  compares the commit with the working tree (like `magit-diff' and
  `git diff') rather than the previous commit.
