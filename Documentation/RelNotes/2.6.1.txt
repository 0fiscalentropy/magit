Magit v2.6.1 Release Notes
==========================

Fixes since v2.6.0
------------------

* When the commit message buffer contained nothing but a single line
  that did not end with a newline, then a warning was shown about
  there being a non-empty second line.

* Stash and wipref were needlessly signed if signing is enabled.

* Visiting a blob did turn on `diff-hl-mode' if the global mode is on.

* Rewinded submodules were not shown in the status buffer.

* When installing from Melpa `async-bytecomp-package-mode' was no
  longer activated early enough.

This release also contains documentation updates, typofixes, fixes for
minor bugs, and other small improvements.
