Magit v2.6.1 Release Notes
==========================

Fixes since v2.6.0
------------------

* When the commit message buffer contained nothing but a single line
  that did not end with a newline, then a warning was shown about
  there being a non-empty second line.

* Stash and wipref were needlessly signed if signing is enabled.

* Visiting a blob did turn on `diff-hl-mode' if the global mode is on.

* In some cases not all modified submodules were shown in the status
  buffer.

* When a submodule was manually removed, then the status buffer could
  no longer be updated.

* When installing from Melpa `async-bytecomp-package-mode' was no
  longer activated early enough.

* The command `git-commit-save-message' did not strip diffs produced
  by `git commit --verbose'.

* Diffs produced by `git commit --verbose' were not completely
  highlighted in the commit message buffer.

This release also contains documentation updates, typofixes, fixes for
minor bugs, and other small improvements.
