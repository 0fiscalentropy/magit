Magit v2.9.1 Release Notes (unreleased)
=======================================

Changes since v2.9.0
--------------------

* The function `magit-display-buffer' now sets the focus on the frame
  used to display the selected window.  #2865

* Many doc-strings were improved, added, and fixed.

* The obsolete variable `magit-repository-directory-depth' is no
  longer defined as an option.

Fixes since v2.9.0
------------------

* Customizations of hooks were ignored, if the `custom-set-variables'
  form was evaluated before the Magit libraries were loaded.  #2902

* When rebase stopped at a commit, point was no longer placed on that
  commit.  #2884

* When creating a commit, `magit-display-buffer-fullcolumn-most-v1'
  filled the entire frame, hiding the commit message buffer.  #2891

* The commands `magit-reflog' and `magit-reflog-current' reported
  a revision's reflog as empty when the name of a file in the
  repository, relative to the top-level directory, matched the
  revision name.  5264ffcb

* The function `magit-repolist-column-upstream' returned the current
  branch instead of its upstream.  46acbd6d

* The functions `magit-repolist-column-unpulled-from-upstream' and
  `magit-repolist-column-unpushed-to-upstream' raised a type error
  if the upstream was configured but did not exist.  #2904

* The shell command generated by `magit-emacs-Q-command' could end
  up trying to load a directory as a library, due to a bug in Emacs.
