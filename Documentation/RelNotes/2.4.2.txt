Magit v2.4.2 Release Notes (draft)
==================================

Updates since v2.4.1
--------------------

* The heading of the section which lists commits that exist in the
  current branch but not in its upstream, was changed from "Unpushed
  to <upstream>" to "Unmerged into <upstream>", because one usually
  should merge into that branch instead of pushing to it.

Fixes since v2.4.1
------------------

* Creating a stash in a secondary working tree failed if no other
  stash already existed in the repository.

* Creating a Magit buffer failed if `uniquify-buffer-name-style's
  value is `nil'.

* Resetting a branch to an arbitrary commit (not another branch),
  caused its upstream configuration to be mangled.

* The manually set state of the margin in log and reflog buffers was
  not preserved and instead reset to the default state, when a command
  was invoked which changes what log/reflog is being displayed.

This release also contains typofixes and documentation updates.
