Magit v2.4.2 Release Notes (draft)
==================================

Updates since v2.4.1
--------------------

* Added new option `auto-revert-buffer-list-filter' and redefined
  `auto-revert-buffers' from `autorevert.el' to use it.  Added new
  predicates `magit-auto-revert-buffer-p' and the more restrictive
  `magit-auto-revert-repository-buffer-p', which are both intended
  to be used as potential value of the option.

  For now the option defaults to `nil', but that might change in a
  future release.  When Magit explicitly calls `auto-revert-buffers'
  (as opposed to when that is called due to a file notification event
  or by a timer), and `auto-revert-buffer-list-filter' is `nil', then
  it is let-bound to `magit-auto-revert-repository-buffer-p'.

  Users who use Tramp and experience delays, should consider setting
  the option to `magit-auto-revert-repository-buffer-p'.

* The heading of the section which lists commits that exist in the
  current branch but not in its upstream was changed from "Unpushed
  to <upstream>" to "Unmerged into <upstream>", because one usually
  should merge into that branch instead of pushing to it.

* Added new commands `magit-remote-set-head' and
  `magit-remote-unset-head'.

* By default `magit-clone' now deletes the symbolic-ref "origin/HEAD"
  right after running `git clone', which insists on creating it.

  The new option `magit-clone-set-remote-head' can be set to `t' to go
  back to keeping that symbolic-ref.  We default to removing it,
  because it does not actually get automatically updated when the
  HEAD of the remote changes, and that makes it rather pointless.

* Added new option `magit-prefer-remote-upstream' which controls
  whether commands which read the upstream or starting-point from
  the user would rather offer a local or a remote branch as default
  completion candidate.

Fixes since v2.4.1
------------------

* Creating a stash in a secondary working tree failed if no other
  stash already existed in the repository.

* Creating a Magit buffer failed if `uniquify-buffer-name-style's
  value is `nil'.

* Resetting a branch to an arbitrary commit caused its upstream
  configuration to be mangled.

* Resetting a branch to another branch caused the former to be
  configured as the upstream of the latter.  That behavior was
  introduced by accident when the argument `--track' was replaced with
  the variable `branch.autoSetupMerge' in the popup.  Because it would
  be undesirable to restore the `--track' argument in the popup, one
  now has to use a prefix argument to set the upstream while resetting.

* The manually set state of the margin in log and reflog buffers was
  not preserved and instead reset to the default state when a command
  was invoked which changes what log/reflog is being displayed.

This release also contains typofixes and documentation updates.
