Magit v2.4.2 Release Notes (draft)
==================================

Updates since v2.4.1
--------------------

* The heading of the section which lists commits that exist in the
  current branch but not in its upstream, was changed from "Unpushed
  to <upstream>" to "Unmerged into <upstream>", because one usually
  should merge into that branch instead of pushing to it.

Fixes since v2.4.1
------------------

This release also contains typofixes and documentation updates.
