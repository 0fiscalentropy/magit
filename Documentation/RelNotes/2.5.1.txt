Magit v2.5.1 Release Notes (draft)
==================================

Updates since v2.5.0
--------------------

* Added a cache, which memorizes the values of some function calls for
  the duration of a refresh.  This cuts the calls to git in half.

* Added new command `magit-push-refspecs', which allows pushing using
  one or more comma-separated and refspecs, which are explicitly typed
  in the minibuffer.

* When washing the diff that is to be displayed while writing a
  commit message takes too long, then it is now possible to abort that
  by pressing `C-g'.  Previously that would have aborted the commit.

Fixes since v2.5.0
------------------

* If the user sets the variable `magit-auto-revert-mode' or the
  obsolete alias `magit-revert-buffers' to nil anytime during startup,
  before or after `magit-autorevert' is loaded, then the mode is not
  turned on (actually it is explicitly turned off).

* `magit-insert-unpulled-from-pushremote' and
  `magit-insert-unpushed-to-pushremote' missed an edge case when
  checking whether their section should be inserted into the status
  buffer.

* `magit-clone' did not switch to the cloned repo before trying to
  delete the symbolic-ref "origin/HEAD".

* `magit-merge-preview' did not recognize sections for added or
  deleted files.

* `magit-run-git-with-input' had stopped calling
  `magit-pre-call-git-hook' and logging its git command to the
  magit-process buffer.

* On `windows-nt' systems, having `mount' in `exec-path' caused Magit
  to assume that git is from Cygwin.
