Magit v2.8.1 Release Notes (draft)
==================================

Changes since v2.8.0
--------------------

* The environment variable `INSIDE_EMACS' is now set when calling git.

* The `--gpg-sign=' option is now also available from the revert
  popup.

Fixes since v2.8.0
------------------

* Command `magit-list-repositories' failed on empty git repositories.

* The Git variable `pull.rebase' was ignored when determining whether
  the current branch is being rebased onto its upstream in order to
  display that information in the status buffer.

* When `--force-with-lease' was added to the `magit-push-popup',
  `--force' was removed, but sometimes the former just isn't enough.

* On 32bit systems `magit-format-log-margin' failed because it tried
  to truncate a time float that was to large for that.  #2765

* On Emacs v25.1 the hunk internal region flashed briefly on
  mouse-down-1 events.  #2758
