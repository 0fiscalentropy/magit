It's magit!  Another Emacs mode for git.

I wrote magit while learning about git and trying to figure out how I
would be using git in a 'natural' way.  Magit will grow and hopefully
become more coherent as I learn more about git and good ways to use
it.  Feedback is welcome!

* Installing

Magit is in such an early stage that there is no support for
automatically installing it.  To use magit without installing it, just
load magit.el into Emacs, in whatever way is most convenient for you.

For example, you could just add

   (load ".../magit.el")

to your ".emacs" file.  You can load it into your running Emacs with
'M-x load-file'.

* Getting started

To get started with magit, open any file in a git repository in Emacs
and run 'M-x magit-status'.  Read the online help of magit-mode ('C-h
m' in the magit buffer), make some changes to your files, and try to
commit them.

* Learning more

The Magit User Manual describes things with more words than the online
help.  You can read it with 

* Updates

You can follow magit development by cloning
